<h2>
Audio data to Streams and Back. 
</h2>
<p>
Some rough cut demo to collect/display audio data. 

</p>
<h3>Notes regarding demo.</h3>
<ul>
<li>This works on FireFox, I have had difficulties with Chrome and Safari.</li> 
<li>You must have a very good data line to get to Streams on BlueMix. This wants to push 44k samples per second .</li>
<li>You can have multiple connection transmitting, using the 'Record Audio' page.</li>
<li>The 'Record Audio' page transmits data only after you toggle the 'Transmit to Streams' box, you know it's sending when the background turns red.</li>
<li>This works nicely with two displays.</li>

</ul>

<dd>Record Audio Stream, stream to Streams. This attaches to the browsers microphone.<br>
If multiple laptops connect, you'll see them in the monitor page below.
</dd>

<dt><a target="_blank" href="./monitor.html">Monitor Audio</a></dt>
<dd>Monitor the Audio that has been processed on streams. Multiple Streams are monitored from here.  </dd>

<dt><a target="_blank" href="http://onlinetonegenerator.com/?freq=7040">Tone Generator</a>
<dd>Use this to generate a 7040Khz done, this will cause data to appear in lowest output box.</dd>

<dt><a target="_blank" href="./rawAudio.html">Raw Audio</a></dt>
<dd>Audio at 1/2 speed. This only works if you read the code (VERY DANGEROUS) </dd>

<h3>The flow of data.</h3> 
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="./recorder.html">Record Audio</a> opens microphone on laptop, collect audio data at 44kHz.(Record Audio) </li>
<li>Pack up the audio data, send to Liberty using WebSockets</li>
<li>Forward Messages onto Streams WebSocket source operator</li>
<li>Streams packets the audio into tuples of 4096 samples. </li>
<li>4096 samples are decomposed into single samples tuples.</li>
<li>4096 tuples windowed and processed by FFT operator.</li>
<li>FFT magnitude output and broken into 10 chunks</li>
<li>Magnitude converted to percentage, drop the upper 6 chunks.</li>
<li>Transmit the 4 lowest chunks to Liberty using WebSocket sink. </li>
<li>Liberty forwards onto waiting monitor page</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="./monitor.html">Monitor Audio</a> renders the 4 chunks to 4 graphs.</li>

</ul>

</ul>
	
This application sends message through a proxy to Streams. Due to security provided by 
BlueMix we cannot make a direct connection to Streams, thus the proxy. 
This proxy forwards data from the public internet to Streams which is residing in 
the protected lair of BlueMix.

</ul>
