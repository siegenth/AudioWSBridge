Entry page for testing/examples.

<p>
Some rough cut tests to collect/display audio data, rip this code up to do what you need
to do.

- steal from your friends.

<dl>
<h3>You need to be on FireFox to get the audio to work. Chrome has 'issues' when it's not local and http (security).</h3>

<dt><a href="./recorder.html">Record Audio</a></dt>
<dd>Record Audio Stream, stream to Streams. This attaches to the browsers microphone.<br>
If multiple laptops connect, you'll see them in the monitor page below.
</dd>

<dt><a href="./monitor.html">Monitor Audio</a></dt>
<dd>Monitor the Audio that has been processed on streams. Multiple Streams are monitored from here.  </dd>

<dt><a href="./Forward.html">Forward control </a></dt>
<dd>Send DEBUG Messages : Converse of Below, to get messages to Streams</dd>

<dt><a href="./Backward.html">Backward control </a></dt>
<dd>Send DEBUG Messages : Convert of Above, get messages from Streams</dd>
</dl>

<H3>Notes:</H3>
<ul>
<li>This application sends message through a proxy to Streams. Due to security provided by 
BlueMix we cannot make a direct connection to Streams, thus the proxy</li>
<li>This proxy forwards data from the public internet to Streams which is residing in 
the protected lair of BlueMix. The proxy server needs the IP address of the 
Steams application. This is not as straight forward as I would like..
<br>Steps...  
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Get the IP address the streams application.</li>
<li>Get the configuration of the Streams application. </li>
<li>Execute the curl command incorporating the data from the configuration </li>
<li>The result will provide the IP mapping. </li>
<li>The (recorder/monitor) pages have a input box put this value.</li>
</ol>
